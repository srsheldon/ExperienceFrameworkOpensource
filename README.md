# ExperienceFrameworkOpensource (EFO)

> This isn't supposed to be another component library, there are already hundreds of them out there and I don't like the idea of "reinventing the wheel." I am just a hands on learner and I want to learn how awesome component libraries like [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io/) and [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) work. So this repo is really only for my learning

The goal is to work with the browser(s) and learn the best way to implemnt the available technology to enhance users experience on the web.

## Colors
colors will be based on HTTP status codes:
100 = info
200 = success
300 = warning
400 = danger/error

see:

* http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml

add a helper class to auto format text color based on background color: https://css-tricks.com/css-variables-calc-rgb-enforcing-high-contrast-colors/

Archedecture approach is that attributes add functionality and classes add appearance/style changes
