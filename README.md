# ExperienceFrameworkOpensource (EFO)

> This isn't supposed to be another component library, there are already hundreds of them out there and I don't like the idea of "reinventing the wheel." I am just a hands on learner and I want to learn how awesome component libraries like [Onsen UI](https://onsen.io/) and [polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) work. So this repo is really only for my learning

The goal is to work with the browser(s) and learn the best way to implemnt the available technology to enhance users experience on the web.
